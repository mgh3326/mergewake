# Releasing mergewake

## Cut a release

1. Merge the change to `main`.
2. Fetch `main` so that `origin/main` is the merge commit, then tag it and
   push the tag:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin main
   git tag vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH origin/main
   git push origin vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
   ```
3. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds CGO-disabled (`CGO_ENABLED=0`, `-trimpath`) binaries named `mergewake-<os>-<arch>`. It builds four targets: linux/amd64,
   linux/arm64, darwin/amd64 and darwin/arm64. It stamps the tag as the
   version and writes `SHA256SUMS`. It checks that `mergewake --version`
   prints the tag. It runs the tests. Then it publishes the GitHub Release
   with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Pushing a test tag `v0.0.0-<anything>` (for example `v0.0.0-test.1`) runs
the same build and checks on a real tag and publishes nothing.

Every pull request runs the same build and checks for the dry-run tag
`v0.0.0-dryrun.<run>`, and publishes nothing. To run the same check locally:

```sh
sh scripts/build-release.sh v0.0.0-dryrun.1 dist/release
sh scripts/verify-release.sh v0.0.0-dryrun.1 dist/release
```

A tag with a `-suffix` (`v1.2.3-rc.1`) builds the same way and is published
as a *pre-release*. Hosts that follow `latest` skip pre-releases. Pin the tag
on a host to try it there.

## How hosts get it

No workflow connects to a host. On each host, the fleet updater
(`fleet-update`) reads the latest release, or the tag pinned for that host.
It verifies the asset against `SHA256SUMS` and swaps the binary atomically.
It keeps the old binary as `mergewake.prev` and restarts the owning service. If
the version or service check fails, it restores `mergewake.prev`.

## Pin, hold, roll back

- **Pin or hold:** set `version=vX.Y.Z` on the host's line in the fleet-update
  manifest. Remove the pin to follow `latest` again.
- **Roll back the fleet:** pin the previous good tag. Alternatively, mark the
  bad release as a pre-release or delete it, so that `latest` points to the
  previous release on the next run.
- **Roll back one host now:** copy the previous binary to a temporary file in
  the same directory and rename it over `mergewake`. A rename works while the
  service still runs the old file, whereas copying onto a running executable
  fails on Linux with `ETXTBSY`:
  ```sh
  cp -p ~/.local/bin/mergewake.prev ~/.local/bin/mergewake.new
  mv -f ~/.local/bin/mergewake.new ~/.local/bin/mergewake
  ```
  Restart the owning service and check that it is active and that the
  version command prints the old tag. Then pin that tag, so that the next
  run does not reinstall the bad release.
